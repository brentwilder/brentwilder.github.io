Teaching
======
* **Co-instructor**, Undergraduate course in applied hydrology and hydraulics for Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 semesters, respectively, at San Diego State University. Highlights included successfully implementing a MATLAB script to create a water balance experiment with the HM-145 machine (which has the potential to be used in virtual settings as well). Additionally, I coordinated with teams of students via Zoom (during COVID-19 pandemic) to assist in the development of semi-distributed HEC-HMS models of the Arroyo Seco watershed located in Los Angeles, California. 
* **Supplemental Instructor**, Undergraduate courses in structural mechanics for Fall 2017, Winter 2018, and Spring 2018 at Cal Poly Pomona. Responsible for helping other engineering students with their coursework including calculus, differential equations, and structural analysis. I was a crucial part of the pilot Supplemental Instructor (SI) program where tutors used IPad's and focused learning sessions to facilitate learning.
  
  
Service and Leadership
======
* Volunteered and led groups (300+ hours) with the [San Diego River Park Foundation](https://sandiegoriver.org/) during the course of my master's degree at San Diego State University
* Volunteered at several events at Cal Poly Pomona through Kellogg Honors College including Matt's Run and Showcase of Excellence


Certifications
======
* **Remote Pilot**, via FAA for Small Unmanned Aircraft System (#4411570)
* **Engineer in Training**, via California Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists (#162671)
