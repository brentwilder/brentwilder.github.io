## Incorrectly modeled diffuse radiance (either from terrain or background) effect on snow reflectance spectra

Due to properties of snow and refractive index of ice, clean snow reflects nearly all light near the visible end of the EM spectrum (350-600 nm). Although the refractive index of ice has a small source of unknown uncertainty (Picard et al., 2016), the relative uncertainty is much smaller than the errors that manifest from incorrect attribution of diffuse light in remote sensing methods.

When solving for snow reflectance quantity, some assumptions must be made in the forward model that represent surface, topography, and atmosphere to estimate the measured signal. However, more research is needed into the best ways of representing nature in the forward model such that the partitioning of direct to diffuse radiance is adequately represented. Any disparities will manifest into what Jeff Dozier dubbed as “the problematic hook” (Figure 1).
