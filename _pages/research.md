NASA’s Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) and ESA’s Copernicus Hyperspectral Imager Mission for Environment (CHIME) will provide sub-monthly, global coverage, enabling important biogeophysical studies to rapidly expand in the coming decade. SBG & CHIME will allow us to model black carbon on snow, chlorophyll in fresh waters, and plant phenology to name a few important processes. In my PhD at Boise State University, I tackled an important research area related to SBG regarding the processing of snow surface properties from a similar sensor, PRISMA. I was able to cut down processing time by using spectral k-means clustering, improve uncertainty propagation by optimally solving for terrain, and create new validation datasets by high resolution helicopter-borne lidar remote sensing.
