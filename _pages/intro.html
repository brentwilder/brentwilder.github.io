In Fall 2024 I completed my PhD in Geosciences from Boise State University. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at JPL. <br><br>

I am broadly interested in remote sensing (both passive and active) to model biogeophysical properties on our planet. Research interests include imaging spectroscopy, remote sensing of snow, and lidar for hydrologic and cryosphere applications. <br><br>
