I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geosciences at Boise State University. <br><br>

I am broadly interested in remote sensing (both passive and active) to model biogeophysical properties on our planet. Research interests include imaging spectroscopy, remote sensing of snow, remote sensing of vegetation and wildfires, and lidar for hydrologic and cryosphere applications. <br><br>

I am passionate about research and I am currently seeking new opportunities post-graduation (expected December 2024). <br><br>
