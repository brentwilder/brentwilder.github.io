In Fall 2024 I completed my PhD in Geosciences from Boise State University. I am currently an Adjunct Instructor at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina. <br><br>

I am broadly interested in remote sensing (both passive and active) to model biogeophysical properties on our planet. Research interests include imaging spectroscopy, remote sensing of snow, remote sensing of vegetation and wildfires, and lidar for hydrologic and cryosphere applications. <br><br>
